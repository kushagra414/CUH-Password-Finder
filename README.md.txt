# CUH Password Finder
By default CUH internet ID and Password are same when generated by the system admin. This Python code will find those ID's which have unchanged Passwords.
Fortunately there are lots of such *IDIOTS* in CUH who do not change their password.
I have implemented a gui, so you just need to give the range for roll number and after runnig the code you will get ID's which have unchanged password.
